In this project, I implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap.
I didn't have a lot of intructions, I were free to implement it the way that I want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

#### My impressions

I used a lot of Bootstrap classes, but I also used a CSS file when I was limited with Bootstrap, for example for some colors or some sizes.
At the beginning, it wasn't easy because there is a lot of classes, but thanks to the documentation of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
I were abble to find a lot of solution, indeed it is possible to be faster when you realize a web page.
